TO ADD a project:
create a directory in /log/ with the repo name (eg /log/wetpaint.com/)
copy the /scripts/wetpaint.com.pl and set it up for that project
run the script: cd scripts && perl wetpaint.com.pl
start running tests by visiting the testswarm address and joining the swarm: http://testswarm.wetpaint.me

TO ADD tests:
read the HOWTO in /tests/ and see the sample in that directory.

TO WRITE QUnit tests:
see the HOWTO in /tests/

TO add jobs:
run the perl script, or do so manually (details next)
or setup the job via Hudson

TO manually add a job to testswarm:
http://testswarm.me/?auth=12345key&job_name=goodjob&max=5&user=jim&browsers=all&output=dump&state=addjob&suites[]=basic&urls[]=http://testswarm.me/tests/test.html
	auth=12345key and 
	user=jim are setup by signing up to your testswarm and then getting the user and auth value from the testswarm mysql db users table
	job_name=label is whatever string you want
	max=5 the max number of times to run the test
	browsers=all values are explained in the sample scripts
	suites[]=label are arbitrary as far as I can tell
	urls[]=http... are fully qualified address of your test (each with the /js/inject.js added per the testswarm wiki)
	output=dump not sure what other options exist
	state=addjob this adds the job

INSTALLATION

1) Create a mysql database and a user who can connect and write to it.

2) Load the MySQL database.

   mysql DBNAME -u USER -p < testswarm.sql
   mysql DBNAME -u USER -p < useragents.sql

3) Copy the ./config/config-sample.ini to ./config.ini and change the options to correspond to your MySQL database information.

4) Copy the ./config/.htaccess-sample to ./htaccess. If needed change the RewriteBase to match the contextpath configuration.

5) Load the cronjob (changing the URL to point to your site).

   crontab << config/cronjob.txt

6) Currently the server must be run in Apache (it uses a .htaccess file).

To run it from non-root, set contextpath = "/testswarm" (or whatever path you use).

And update the .htaccess file, use RewriteBase /testswarm/

Test if /testswarm/login loads, if not, put some jibberish into the .htaccess file to see if its getting loaded. If not, make sure AllowOverride is set to All (at least not to None) in your main Apache config.
