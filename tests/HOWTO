How to setup tests

1 copy the sample iframe to the target project so that the iframe will run same-domain
	eg copy /tests/iframe_sample.html so it's located at http://wetpaint.me/test_iframe.html

2 in the copy edit the options so the options.testpath points to the path of your test javascript on the testswarm server
	eg /tests/wetpaint.com/tests.js

3 write QUnit tests in that javascript file, see /tests/tests.js for an example, 
	read the docs/tutorials at: http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit
	this one is especially good: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/gg749824.aspx

	each test object can have the following properties, and is pushed into the wp.tests array:
	{
		page: '/path/to/page'
		run: function with the actual tests
	}

NOTES for tests: 

window.jq
	is the wrapping iframe's jQuery
	to find the iframe's body tag with jQuery: jq('body');

window.$ = window.jQuery
	is the page's jQuery, ie the page that's loaded into the iframe (if it has jQuery)
	to find the className for the page's body tag: $('body').attr('class');

window.page
	is the window object for the page that's loaded into the iframe, same as window.frames[0]
	to report the page's title: console.log(page.document.title);
